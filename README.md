# SPG - Sunflower Power Generator

We made a model using Arduino UNO R3 ,servos motor, solar panels ,MPPT System and bunch of photo resistors(two actually).<br>
In this our solar panels is rotating 360 degree according to the direction of the Sun.
Which maximizes the output reducing the power wastage and thus increasing the efficiency.
This energy can be used in various purposes according to the power output.<br>
We also used electronic means to maximize the power generated further more by controlling the panel voltage to maximum power point using MPPT(Maximum power point tracking) device.
